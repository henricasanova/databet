        1. Why are we doing this in the first place?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Because our department has voted to pursue ABET accreditation for our Computer Science B.S. degree.

        2. What is DataBET?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          As part of ABET accreditation we need to provide assessment data for our required course, each
          semester. DataBET is the Web app (you're in it right now) that we use to collect <i>assessment data</i>.

        3. What is assessment data?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          For a given course, assessment data is data uploaded by the instructor to DataBET, which provides
          information about particular graded/evaluated student activities in a course. Included in this information
          are the grades, as well as sample <i>poor</i>, <i>mid-range</i>, and <i>good</i> student answers.
          All information is <b>anonymous</b> (no student names, etc.)

        4. Student Outcomes, Performance Indicators, Curriculum Map, ... heh... what?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <ul class="ui list">
          <li>We have defined <i>Student Outcomes (SOs)</i>, which is what we expect students to achieve by the time
          they graduate.</li>
          <li>For each SO we have <i>Performance Indicators (PIs)</i>, i.e., things we can measure
              that make it possible to assess the outcome.</li>
          <li>The <i>Curriculum Map</i>, which we have designed, states for which course which PIs apply.</li>
         </ul>

        5. Is this all set in stone?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
        Not at all, we get to revisit the SOs, the PIs, and the Curriculum Map regularly. So if you see
          something questionable, let the ABET committee know.

        6. What about the "Elementary" vs. "Proficient" thing?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Each PI can come in two flavors: <i>elementary</i> or <i>proficient</i>. These are somewhat subjective
          terms to denote how advanced is an assignment w.r.t a PI.

        7. Do I have to know the Curriculum Map???
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
         Not at all. DataBET will only show you those PIs that are relevant to your courses.

        8. For a course, how much assessment should I do?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The plain answer is "at least one". However, assessing two PIs per course is great. More than
          that is up to you, but we're in good shape even with one (see FAQ #9 though).

        9. For which PIs should I enter assessment data for?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          In many cases, many PIs apply for a single course. You have freedom to pick which PIs you
          want to assess. As we move forward, DataBET will give you suggestions for which PIs would
          be most helpful. It may be that down the road some PIs are imposed (if we lack data). You can
          always talk to the ABET committee and ask what would be most helpful?

        10. What about from semester to semester?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          It is fine to enter data for a previous PI, even using the same or a similar assignment. This
          is good to look at evolutions. The problem with this is that then there are some SOs that are less
          covered, but as mentioned in FAQ #9, the app will provide guidance.

        11. What will happen to my data?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
         To go for accreditation we need to document the process for assessment (DataBET is it). We will also
          generate reports yearly and based on the collected data discuss what could be done to improve
          the curriculum.  The data is really not about you as an instructor.
